For the result:
    void    NIL
    char    'C
    short   'W
    int     'I
    long    'N
    pointer 'P
    string  'S
    float   -1.0
    double  1.0
    lispValue   T
    
    if you want to do something to the result, pass a list
    '('I '(() ) ) where second argument is a function that
    takes the result
    
For arguments:
    pass directly if:
        int long short string(i.e char*)
    for reals:
        float   (N . -1.0)
        double  (N . 1.0)
    for pointers:
        pass a list
        (Var (4 . I)) four ints
    general pointers i dont know
        
for structures if it takes it by pointer then pass directly
otherwise you need a C glue code
    
NOTES:
some functions reuturn char* and say it has to be freed, should I worry about it or native takes care of it?
all the floats are wrong, i write (-1.0 . N) instead it should be (cons N -1.0)
